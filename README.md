# Oh My Goat

A mod to give goats more functionalities.

This mods adds goat meat, goat cheese (made by putting goat milk into a cauldron) and the goat horn with which you can
scare other players and upgrade helmets to horned, thorned helmets. Besides this there are many new advancements and
other small things related to goats.

Plans for this fork:
- Finish porting to Forge
- Port to 1.16.5 with a Caves & Cliffs Backport dependency
